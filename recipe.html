        <h1> <u>HOMEMADE BEEF SLIDERS</u> </h1>
        <P>
            Just last week, my cousins and I wanted to try our hands at something we'd never made before; beef sliders. They came out so great, I decided to share the recipe. If you'ver ever wanted to make your own hamburgers, maybe as a fun activity, or just because? This recipe shows you how to make your own <strong>juicy</strong> beef sliders at home, even the beef patty! It can get a little messy, especially if you’re working with your hands, but it is very tasty and so much fun!
        </P>

        <!-- This section is a step-by-step procedure on how to make and assemble the beef sliders-->
         <h2><u>Instructions</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash your beef with salty water (you can also add vinegar or lemon)</li>
            <li>Slice your beef into very thin, tiny pieces, and add into a bowl. Add some ketchup, salt, pepper and seasonings to taste, and mix with your hands.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and some flour into the bowl and continue mixing. The goal is to bind the beef together, so you can form and cook the patties, so add the flour to your discretion. When properly combined and moldable, set aside to rest</li>
            <li>Pluck and rinse your lettuce with salted water, then thinly slice your cucumbers, onions and tomatoes</li>
            <li>Heat up a frying pan, add a little butter, and sauté your onions, then the tomatoes with a pinch of salt on low heat. Set aside to cool</li>
            <li>Mix your ketchup, mayonnaise, oyster sauce and other seasonings in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Slice open your bread buns, and set them aside on a tray</li>
            <li>Using a lightly greased pan and very low heat, toast the inside of the bread buns</li>
            <li>Then, spread mayo-ketch mix on the toasted side of the bread</li>
            <li>Use a tablespoon to scoop the beef mixture into your hand, and mold into a patty. Be careful not to make it too flat so it doesn’t burn. You can set these aside on a lightly floured tray. The texture of this mix is really weird so you may want to do this near a tap or a bowl of water so you can rinse out your hands in case you get squeamish.</li>
            <li>Melt some more butter in your pan and fry the patty on one side till you get a nice sear. When it’s turning golden brown, flip it and lay a slice of cheese on the now-cooked side.  Take the patty out of the pan when the other side is seared, and the cheese has begun melting. </li>
            <li>To assemble the slider, put a piece of lettuce on the bread, add the patty and cheese, put a dollop of sauce on it, add the cucumber, onion and tomato, and add some more sauce if you want, then toast the whole thing in your pan.</li>
            <li>Serve your slider with fries and a milkshake, or with any sides and drink of your choice.</li>

        <h3><u>Tips</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy premium cuts of beef from the butcher, and take out any connecting tissue when washing your beef.</li>
            <li>Make a dent in one side of the patty to help it retain the round shape when cooking</li>
            <li>You could also use pickles in place of regular cucumber. Make your pickles at home by soaking your cucumbers in brine (water with salt, sugar and vinegar) in an airtight container for three days. </li>
        </ul>
